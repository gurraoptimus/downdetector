- `http://internal.company.com`
- Local development servers
- Internal network services

#### Q: How do I set up automated monitoring?
**A**: You can use the continuous monitoring mode or set up system-level scheduling:
- Use option 3 in the main menu for continuous monitoring
- Set up cron jobs (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows)
- Use systemd services for Linux systems
- Configure Docker containers for automated deployment

#### Q: What's the recommended monitoring interval?
**A**: It depends on your needs:
- **Critical Services**: 30-60 seconds
- **Production Websites**: 2-5 minutes
- **Development Sites**: 5-15 minutes
- **Personal Projects**: 15-30 minutes

Remember: More frequent monitoring uses more resources and may trigger rate limiting.
